# A web based life counter for Magic: the Gathering

A common problem with MTG life counters is incomplete representation of decks involved in a given game. Some apps lets you pick a single color, or maybe even two, but that leaves us Sultai players hanging. Our life counter supports an arbitrary number and order of colors and players, also including name customization.
