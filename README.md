# A web based life counter for Magic: the Gathering

MTG life counters suffer from two problems: you can't display all the colors of your deck and the interface doesn't scale for multiplayer or big screens.

This life counter has these standout features:

 - Assign a name to each deck
 - Choose any combination of colors to paint your banner
 - UI comfortably supports six players on a 1920x1080 desktop screen
 - track alternate forms of damage, including Commander Damage
